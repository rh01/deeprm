# DeepRM3


Deep reinforcement learning for resource managment and job schedule.  it is inspired by deeprm model and I will implement for in practical docker environment. Implement by either pytorch or tensorflow.


## Deadline

- deeprm
- deeprm2
- deeprm3 with cnn,rnn,and rnn-q-network

## Changelog

- 2019/06/13: create repo and update base lib

## Project Schedule

This project will use deep-reinforcement-learning as agent algorithm, and use syn dataset and pratical dataset as training data, and state-of-art model is concered.
